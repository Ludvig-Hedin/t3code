# T3 Code

T3 Code is a minimal web GUI for coding agents (currently Codex and Claude, more coming soon).
It also includes an iOS-first companion app that mirrors the desktop UI and lets you chat with the desktop session from your phone.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> T3 Code currently supports Codex and Claude.
> Install and authenticate at least one provider before use:
>
> - Codex: install [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) and run `codex login`
> - Claude: install Claude Code and run `claude auth login`

### Run without installing

```bash
npx t3
```

### Desktop app

Install the latest version of the desktop app from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/releases), or from your favorite package registry:

#### Windows (`winget`)

```bash
winget install T3Tools.T3Code
```

#### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install --cask t3-code
```

#### Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
yay -S t3code-bin
```

## iOS companion

The iPhone companion lives in [`apps/mobile`](./apps/mobile). It is a native SwiftUI app that connects to the desktop session through the server's mobile relay routes and reuses the same orchestration read model and styling language as the desktop app.

To generate the Xcode project locally:

```bash
cd apps/mobile
xcodegen generate
```
